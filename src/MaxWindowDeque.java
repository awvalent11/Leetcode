//
//    Explanation of the Optimized Approach:
//
//    Deque for Efficient Tracking: We use a deque to store the indices of elements within the current window. The key idea is to maintain the deque in such a way that the element at the front is always the index of the maximum element in the current window.
//
//    Maintaining Decreasing Order: As we iterate through the array, for each new element nums[i], we remove any elements from the back of the deque whose corresponding values are smaller than nums[i]. This ensures that the deque maintains a decreasing order of element values (based on their indices).
//
//    Handling Out-of-Bounds Elements: Before adding the current element's index, we check if the index at the front of the deque is outside the current window (i.e., deque.peekFirst() <= i - k). If it is, we remove it from the front.
//
//    Adding the Current Element: We add the index i of the current element to the back of the deque.
//
//    Recording the Maximum: Once the window size reaches k (i.e., when i >= k - 1), the element at the front of the deque (nums[deque.peekFirst()]) is the maximum element in the current window. We add this maximum to our result array.
//
//     Why is this more compute-efficient?
//
//     Each element in the nums array is added to and removed from the deque at most once.
//     The operations on the deque (adding, removing from front or back, peeking) take constant time, O(1).
//     Therefore, the overall time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the nums array. This is a significant improvement over the original O(nâ‹…k) complexity, especially when k is large.
//     This optimized solution avoids redundant comparisons by efficiently maintaining a data structure that allows us to quickly identify the maximum element in each sliding window.
